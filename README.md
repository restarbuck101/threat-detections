# threat-detections
Threat Detections is a curated repository of detection analytics, designed to identify malicious or suspicious behavior across various platforms, with a primary focus on Microsoft Azure. This collection aims to support security operations, threat hunting, and continuous improvement of detection engineering capabilities. While Azure is the central focus, this repository also includes detections spanning AWS, on-premises infrastructure, and cross-platform telemetry sources where applicable.
# purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide actionable, high-fidelity detections based on real-world adversary behaviors. Each detection is mapped (where applicable) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and aligned with best practices in detection engineering.

# disclaimer
This repository is for educational and research purposes. Use detections responsibly and adapt them to your organization's telemetry, environment, and risk profile.
